Caption: An artist's representation of the Phoenix Stellar Stream. Originally a ball of stars, known as a globular cluster, Phoenix has been stretched into a stream of stars by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way. In a few billion years, Phoenix will be completely destroyed and absorbed into our Galaxy (*Credit: Geraint F. 
and the S5 collaboration*).

For the study, the astronomers targeted bright Red Giant stars, to measure the chemical composition of the disrupted Phoenix globular cluster (Artist’s impression on right).
